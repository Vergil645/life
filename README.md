# life

## Description

Simple `C` implementation of Conway's Game of Life based on `SDL2` library.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Run

```sh
./build/bin/start
```

## LLVM IR

Repository contains LLVM IR of `src/app.c` file in [IR](./IR) directory.
It was generated by [genIR](./genIR) scipt.

## LLVM pass

Source code of the pass and the logger is located in [pass](./pass/) directory.

Script [compileWithPass.sh](./compileWithPass.sh) compiles pass (`libPass.so`) and compiles whole application using this pass.
This script also produces `app_with_trace.ll` IR file located in [IR](./IR) directory.

Pass affects only `void app()` function from `src/app.c` file - it logs running instruction and who uses it.

Pass doesn't log the following instructions:
- `ret`
- `phi`

Analysis script and statistics file are located in [statistics](./statistics/) directory.
Brief summary:
```
"Instruction <- User"           Percentage
------------------------------  ------------
getelementptr <- load           16.8%
getelementptr <- getelementptr  14.9%
load <- add                     14.9%
add <- add                      11.2%
add <- icmp                     5.7%

```

## IRGen

Original source file `app.c` has been modified in order to simplify its IR.
All IR files has been generated again as well as statistics about instruction uses (LLVM pass).

Source code of IR generator is placed in [IRGen](./IRGen/) directory.
Also within [IR](./IR/) directory file `app_gen.ll` has been placed, which contains generated IR.
